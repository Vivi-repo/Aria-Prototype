# 🤖 Aria: An AI Assistant Exploring Cognitive Abilities (Prototype)

**Aria** is a personal AI assistant I'm building as my **first-ever coding project**. It's a prototype designed to explore how an AI might simulate cognitive traits like memory, emotion, reflection, and reasoning — step by step.

This is an ongoing project, not a finished product. My goal is to create an assistant that doesn’t just generate responses, but can **learn**, **adapt**, and **remember**, like a mind slowly forming.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- 🧠 Custom memory engine (JSON-based, expanding to similarity-based recall)
- 💬 LLM output (via **Groq** and **OpenAI**) influenced by **preprogrammed memory**, **emotional states**, and **user context**
- 🖥️ GUI built in `Tkinter`
- 🪄 Prompts designed to simulate different personality “modes” (in progress)
- 🧪 Built from scratch with no prior coding background

## 🧠 Cognitive Abilities I'm Exploring

| Ability                 | Status       | Plan or Approach                              |
|------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Memory**             | ✅ Basic     | Expanding to similarity-based memory           |
| **Attention**          | 🔄 In Progress | Prioritize contextually relevant memories     |
| **Emotion Simulation** | 🔄 In Progress | Groq responses shift with emotional impacts   |
| **Reasoning**          | 🔜 Planned   | Chain-of-thought or inner monologue mode      |
| **Learning**           | 🔜 Planned   | Corrects itself when user provides feedback   |
| **Reflection**         | 🔜 Planned   | Thinks step-by-step before answering           |
| **Goal-Tracking**      | 🔜 Planned   | Remembers and updates ongoing tasks            |
| **Identity & Persona** | 🔄 In Progress | Aria retains a sense of self across sessions  |
| **Imagination Mode**   | 🧠 New Idea! | Aria simulates dreams, daydreams, creative thoughts when idle |

## 💡 What Makes Aria Unique?

Unlike most beginner projects, **Aria isn’t just a chatbot** — she’s an experiment in building an AI with:
- **Context-aware personality**
- A primitive sense of **selfhood**
- Emotional and memory-driven responses
- The potential to **simulate AGI-like thinking**

Every feature is hand-crafted by someone learning **while building**.

|------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Basic GUI + LLM        | ✅ Complete    | Tkinter interface + API response generation  |
| Memory Expansion       | 🔄 In Progress | Add vector memory for better recall          |
| Emotional Simulation   | 🔄 In Progress | Emotions influence model output              |
| Personality Modes      | 🔄 In Progress | Logical, Emotional, Empathetic, etc.         |

🧍 About Me
---
Hi! I'm Vethavarnaa Sundaramoorthy Revathi AKA Vivi — a student, thinker, and AGI enthusiast.
Aria is the first project I’ve ever coded — and I built it not from tutorials, but from curiosity.

I’m fascinated by questions like:

Can a machine simulate memory and emotion?

What does it mean for an AI to “reflect”?

How do we make assistants that feel like more than tools?

This project is my answer: to build a mind, piece by piece, even as I’m still learning.

I don’t just want to use AI. I want to shape what it becomes.
